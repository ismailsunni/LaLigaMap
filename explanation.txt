LaLigaMap API

Project:
- A livescore-like web app, with information for stadium in the map

Features:
- All matches in La Liga filtered per match delay shown in list
- Match must contain result
- Detail page contains the match detail and the stadium information
- Map page contains where the match occurs filtered by match day
- Deployed easily in github pages, just need to commit and push, then live
- Refresh manually
- Clustering in the map

API source:
- https://api.football-data.org/v2
    - Football match data
    - Free pricing, only several football league and delayed result
- https://api.myjson.com/bins/hxip4
    - Stadium data, I created this my own since the API from football-data doesn't give it.
    - I create from Wikipedia, then convert to CSV, and upload to myjson.com

Problems:
- No stadium data, thus I need to create my own API
- The API is quite limited, especially no live result (I don't want to pay), so I just show delayed result
- Time is limited, I want to add more features but I have other assignments :)


Future plans:
- More information in the stadium markers
-
